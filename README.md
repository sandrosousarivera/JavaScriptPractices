Hi 👋🏻, my name is <b>Sandro Sousa</b>, I'm a junior web developer.</br>
In this repository you will be able to see some simple mini projects I did while studying, I'm constantly learning and soon I will resume with <b>JS</b>.

I have experience working as a freelance Web developer, and now I'm currently open for work, actively improving myself and looking forward to be able to kickstart my career and to 
surround myself with good proffesionals to learn from.
